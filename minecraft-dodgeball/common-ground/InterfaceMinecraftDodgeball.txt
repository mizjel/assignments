INTERFACE:

Op basis van de opbouw:
	-createPlayingField 
		--> determines the position and size of the playing field, 
			divided into two sides that each belong to a team
			--> think about making pre-fab arena? 
	-assignPlayerToTeam
		--> makes sure every player is assigned to a team
	-teleportTrespasser
		--> teleports any player who goes beyond the bounds of their 
			own side of the field, whether to the opposite's side or 
			off to the sides
	-spawnResources
		--> (re)spawns the resources needed for attack and defense
			--> possibly built-in randomness with a 80/20 chance of 
				getting a base-level resource versus a premium resource
	
Op basis van de Squid Squad opdrachten:
	-throwMissile
		--> a way to attack a target or player, for example by 
			throwing a block of dynamite or exploding arrow
	-simulateWindSpeed
		--> relevant for throwing the missiles
	-spawnMonster
		--> (optionally?) spawns a creeper or other monster when a 
			defensive shield is built
			--> can damage defensive structures but not the target,
				spawns on the opponent's side of field and can't 
				leave it (subject to teleportTrespasser)
	-explodeMonster
		--> makes the monster explode (implicit in creepers?) 
			
	
Op basis van de Team Octo opdrachten:	
	-createTarget
		--> towers or cubes made out of destructible blocks (walls can
			be built with resources available at the start of the game)
	-spawnShield
		--> makes a temporary shield that can be damaged by monsters 
			and missiles
	-destroyShield
		--> shatters the shield when a block is destroyed
	-createAntiAircraft
		--> creates turret or the like that can destroy incoming
			missiles automatically once loaded
	-loadAntiAircraft
		--> gives the turret a number of 'bullets' with which to destroy
			incoming missiles
	
Voor allebei nodig:
	-consumeResource
		--> makes sure enough resources are available for the action 
			being undertaken, destroys them/uses them up
			--> place a crafting table somewhere for higher level 
				offense/defense?
